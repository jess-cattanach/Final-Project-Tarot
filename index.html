<h1>A First Step Into Tarot</h1>

<h2>Learn the Basic Information!</h2>
<p> Around the 19th century, the tarot card set began to be associated with divination and the occult and evolved into what we know it as today. Lots of sites have overwhelming information, this one has compressed it to be as simple as possible!</p>

<p>   The deck consists of 78 cards, the major and minor arcana. The major arcana consists of 22 named cards. The minor arcana consists of four suits with 14 cards each. The Rider-Waite deck is the most well known and recognizable deck, all images below are derived from this set.</p>

<h2>Why Practice Tarot?</h2>
<p>   Tarot is apart of diviniation work, meaning it's used to uncover hidden significance or cause. In this case, tarot falls under "fortune telling," but they do not necessarily predict the future. Tarot can be used to look for insight and reassurance into past, present, and future events. They are best used for clarity and self-reflection.</p>
